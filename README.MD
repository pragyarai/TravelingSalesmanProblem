Solved the Traveling Salesman problem — 
The traveling salesperson problem (also known as TSP) is a well known and important combinatorial optimization problem. The goal here is to find the shortest tour for the salesman to visits each city exactly once and then returns to the starting city. Following algorithms are implemented:1. Hill Climbing2. A* with MST heuristic

Hill Climbing:It’s a greedy algorithm which looks to its immediate neighbors to find the local minimum/ maximum. This process is repeated till the algorithm finds a solution but sometimes the algorithm gets stuck. To get out of that state it generates a random state and continues with the process till it finds the solution.A*: It is widely used  in path finding and graph traversal. While traversing through the graph, it builds up a tree of partial paths. It always finds the optimum solution to reach the goal state. The heuristic estimate is the combination of the cost to reach a goal and the distance traveled from the initial node. Specifically, the cost function isf(n)=g(n) +h(n)Here, g(n) is the known cost of getting from the initial node to n. h(n) is a heuristic estimate of the cost to get from n to any goal node. In A* the heuristic function must be admissible meaning that it never overestimates the actual cost to get to the nearest goal node.
